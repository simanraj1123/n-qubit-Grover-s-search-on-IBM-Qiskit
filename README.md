# n-qubit Grover's search algorithm on IBM Qiskit

This code is the additional material for the article __Grover's search algorithm for n qubits with optimal number of iterations__.

The code is written in python3 along with the use of the "qiskit" package maintained by [IBM Quantum Experience](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/). To install and setup the package, refer to the [installation guide](https://qiskit.org/documentation/install.html).

Requirements:

1. Python 3.5+
2. Jupyter notebook
3. Numpy package
4. Matplotlib package
5. Qiskit package
